## 1. Creation patterns
### i. Factory pattern
![alt text](../img/Factory2.png)  
- Intent: dynamically create objects without know how to initialize them. Can be easily extend same type of object without duplicate code.  
- SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle     
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### ii. Abstract Factory pattern
![alt text](../img/AbstractFactoryPattern.png)  
- Intent: create multiple factories for differents families of related objects.  
- SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### iii. Singleton pattern
- Intent: guarantee create only one instance of object.  
- SOLID: no  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### iv. Builder pattern
- Intent: build a complex object step by step.  
- SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### v. Prototype pattern
- Intent: provide clone method inside class for easy to create object without calling constructor.   
- SOLID:  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

## 2. Structural patterns
### i. Adapter pattern
Intent: create an adapter between two classes.  
SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### ii. Bridge pattern
Intent: split abstraction and implementation for developing independently.  
SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### iii. Filter pattern
Intent: create an filter logic which can be chained to adapt complex logic.  
SOLID: Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### iv. Composite pattern
Intent: create an complex object which has hierarchial structure.  
SOLID:  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### v. Decorator pattern
Intent: adding new logic without alter original class.  
SOLID: Open/Closed Principle  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### vi. Facade pattern
Intent: provide an interface to hide the complexity of the system.  
SOLID:  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### vii. Flyweight pattern
Intent: group common attributes into a class and reuse it to decrease memory for create object.   
SOLID:  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)  

### viii. Proxy pattern
Intent: provide an proxy class to control access to original class.  
SOLID:  
[Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)
